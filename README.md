# ResolutionAI

**AI-powered scheduling for busy families.** Eliminate decision fatigue, share the mental load, and finally stop arguing about who does what.

## The Real Problem

It's Tuesday night. Dinner's done. And then it starts.

> *"Did you book the pediatrician?"*
> *"I thought you were doing that."*
> *"I did the groceries. And signed the school forms. And—"*
> *"I've been in back-to-back meetings!"*
> *"So have I! While also remembering that we're out of milk!"*

**Sound familiar?**

This isn't about who does more. It's about the **invisible work** of remembering who does what, and when.

Research shows one partner carries **71% of the mental load** — the planning, the scheduling, the constant juggling. It's exhausting. And it causes resentment.

---

## The Solution

**ResolutionAI** is an AI scheduling assistant that takes control of your family's time — so you can stop thinking about logistics and start living.

```
Your Goals + Both Calendars + Life Constraints = A Plan That Actually Works
```

### How It Works

| Step | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| 1. **Connect** | Link your Google/Outlook calendars (both partners) |
| 2. **Define** | Add your goals and household tasks |
| 3. **Configure** | Set work hours, commutes, and personal time |
| 4. **Optimize** | AI distributes tasks fairly based on real availability |
| 5. **Execute** | Everyone knows what they're doing and when |

## Built for Families

### The Mental Load Problem

| The Reality | The Impact |
|-------------|------------|
| One partner carries **71%** of household mental load | Burnout and resentment |
| "I thought you were doing that" | Dropped balls, arguments |
| Invisible work goes unnoticed | Unfair distribution persists |
| **35,000 decisions** per day | Decision fatigue by 3 PM |

### How ResolutionAI Solves It

- **Shared Family Calendar** - Both partners see everything in one place
- **Fair Task Distribution** - AI assigns based on actual availability, not assumptions
- **Visible Accountability** - No more "I do everything" debates — the data shows the truth
- **Reduced Mental Load** - Stop remembering, start doing

### The Transformation

**Before ResolutionAI:**
> *"Did you book the car service?"*
> *"I thought you were."*
> [Argument ensues]

**After ResolutionAI:**
> *"Dinner's done."*
> *"Nice. I've got laundry tomorrow, you've got the pharmacy run."*
> *"Already in my calendar. Want to watch something?"*

**One less thing to argue about.**

## Key Features

### Intelligent Time Protection

- **Personal Time Window** - Set when you're available (6 AM - 11 PM, you decide)
- **Work Schedule Awareness** - AI knows your work hours and won't schedule during them
- **Commute Blocking** - Morning and evening commute times are protected
- **Vacation & Holiday Support** - Time off is automatically respected

### Hybrid AI Scheduling

Our unique **Deterministic + AI** approach ensures predictable, intelligent scheduling:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    HYBRID SCHEDULING ENGINE                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                  │
│   DETERMINISTIC LAYER (Predictable)                             │
│   ├── Frequency: "4x per week" = exactly 4 scheduled slots      │
│   ├── Fixed Days: "Monday, Wednesday, Friday" = those days only │
│   ├── Fixed Times: "7:00 AM" = that exact time                  │
│   └── Constraints: Work hours, commute, vacations respected     │
│                                                                  │
│   AI LAYER (Intelligent)                                         │
│   ├── Optimal time selection within available slots             │
│   ├── Energy pattern awareness (morning vs evening person)      │
│   ├── Calendar conflict avoidance                               │
│   └── Fair family task distribution                             │
│                                                                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Result:** You get the predictability of rules-based scheduling with the intelligence of AI optimization.

## The Mindset Shift

ResolutionAI is built for families who want to:

| Traditional Thinking | ResolutionAI Thinking |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| "I need to find time to exercise" | "My exercise time is protected automatically" |
| "I'll do chores when I have time" | "Life admin is scheduled like any meeting" |
| "Whose turn is it?" | "The schedule shows fair distribution" |
| "You never help around here" | "Data proves who did what this week" |
| "I'm always the one who remembers" | "AI remembers for both of us" |
| "I don't know what to do next" | "Decision fatigue eliminated" |

## AI Learning & Observability

We don't just claim the AI improves - **we prove it** with [Comet Opik](https://www.comet.com/site/products/opik/).

### You Control What AI Learns

Unlike black-box AI systems, **ResolutionAI puts you in control of your data.**

Every time you complete or skip a task, you choose:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ✓ Task Completed: "Morning Run"                       │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                        │
│  Should AI learn from this?                            │
│                                                        │
│  [Yes, learn my preferences]  [No, just this once]     │
│                                                        │
│  ℹ️ AI will note that you prefer morning exercise      │
│                                                        │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why this matters:**
- Skipped a task because of an emergency? Don't let it skew your preferences.
- Completed something at an unusual time? Keep it as a one-off.
- Want AI to learn faster? Opt in to every action.

**Your preferences. Your control. Your choice.**

### What We Track

| Metric | What It Measures |
|--------|------------------|
| **Scheduling Accuracy** | Did tasks happen at scheduled times? |
| **Completion Rate** | Overall task completion trending over weeks |
| **Time Preference Learning** | Morning person? Evening person? AI adapts |
| **Family Fairness Score** | Even distribution of household tasks |
| **Burnout Prevention** | Detecting over-scheduling before it happens |

### The Learning Loop

```
User completes task at 7 PM → AI asks "Learn from this?" → User says Yes
    → AI notes "evening preference"

User skips 6 AM task → AI asks "Learn from this?" → User says No
    → AI ignores this one-off skip

Week over week: Schedules get smarter based on YOUR choices
```

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/resolution-ai.git

### Testing with Demo Data

We provide a demo seed endpoint for testing:

```bash
# Seed demo data
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/demo/seed

# Check current state
curl http://localhost:3000/api/demo/seed
```

This creates realistic demo data including:
- A family with two members (different work schedules)
- Focus tasks (exercise, meditation, reading)
- Life admin tasks (groceries, school pickup, laundry)
- 2 weeks of historical completions
- AI learned preferences
