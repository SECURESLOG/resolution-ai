# ResolutionAI

**AI-powered scheduling that eliminates decision fatigue and brings work-life balance.**

---

## The Problem

**We're overwhelmed.** Modern life demands we juggle:

- Work calendars packed with meetings
- Household responsibilities that never end
- Personal goals we never find time for
- Family obligations competing for attention

The result? **Decision fatigue.** Every day we waste mental energy deciding *when* to do things instead of just *doing* them. We over-schedule, burn out, and watch our productivity goals slip away.

---

## The Solution

**ResolutionAI** is an AI scheduling assistant that takes control of your time - so you don't have to think about it.

```
Your Goals + Your Calendar + Your Life Constraints = A Plan That Actually Works
```

### How It Works

| Step | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| 1. **Connect** | Link your Google/Outlook calendar and set your work schedule |
| 2. **Define** | Add your productivity goals and life admin tasks |
| 3. **Configure** | Set your available hours, work times, commute, and time off |
| 4. **Optimize** | AI analyzes your schedule and finds the perfect time slots |
| 5. **Execute** | Drag, drop, and complete - your week is planned |

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    HYBRID SCHEDULING ENGINE                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

│   DETERMINISTIC LAYER (Predictable)                             │
│   ├── Frequency: "4x per week" = exactly 4 scheduled slots      │
│   ├── Fixed Days: "Monday, Wednesday, Friday" = those days only │
│   ├── Fixed Times: "7:00 AM" = that exact time                  │
│   └── Constraints: Work hours, commute, vacations respected     │
│                                                                  │
│   AI LAYER (Intelligent)                                         │
│   ├── Optimal time selection within available slots             │
│   ├── Energy pattern awareness (morning vs evening person)      │
│   ├── Calendar conflict avoidance                               │
│   └── Fair family task distribution                             │
│                                                                  │

## AI Learning & Observability

We don't just claim the AI improves - **we prove it** with [Comet Opik](https://www.comet.com/site/products/opik/).

### You Control What AI Learns

Unlike black-box AI systems, **ResolutionAI puts you in control of your data.**

Every time you complete or skip a task, you choose:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ✓ Task Completed: "Morning Run"                       │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                        │
│  Should AI learn from this?                            │
│                                                        │
│  [Yes, learn my preferences]  [No, just this once]     │
│                                                        │
│  ℹ️ AI will note that you prefer morning exercise      │
│                                                        │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why this matters:**
- Skipped a task because of an emergency? Don't let it skew your preferences.
- Completed something at an unusual time? Keep it as a one-off.
- Want AI to learn faster? Opt in to every action.

**Your preferences. Your control. Your choice.**

### What We Track

| Metric | What It Measures |
|--------|------------------|
| **Scheduling Accuracy** | Did tasks happen at scheduled times? |
| **Completion Rate** | Overall task completion trending over weeks |
| **Time Preference Learning** | Morning person? Evening person? AI adapts |
| **Family Fairness Score** | Even distribution of household tasks |
| **Burnout Prevention** | Detecting over-scheduling before it happens |

### The Learning Loop

```
User completes task at 7 PM → AI asks "Learn from this?" → User says Yes
    → AI notes "evening preference"

User skips 6 AM task → AI asks "Learn from this?" → User says No
    → AI ignores this one-off skip

Week over week: Schedules get smarter based on YOUR choices
```
